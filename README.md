# OT-ICS-Con-List
A partially vetted[^1] list of conferences either focused on OT/ICS cybersecurity, or where there is a history of OT/ICS-focused presenters and attendees. 

[^1]: Partially vetted means it could be recommended by a friend, or an acquantance, or a friend-of-a-friend, or maybe an acquaintance-of-somebody-who-made-a-pull-request.
